/*
Write a do/while loop that repeatedly prints a certain message until the user tells the program to stop. The do/while is appropriate because the message should always be printed at least one time, even if the user types n after the first message appears. The message to be printed is as follows:

She sells seashells by the seashore.
Do you want to hear it again? y
She sells seashells by the seashore.
Do you want to hear it again? y
She sells seashells by the seashore.
Do you want to hear it again? n
