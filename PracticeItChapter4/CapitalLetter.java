/*
Write an if statement that tests to see whether a String stored in a variable named phrase begins with a capital letter. If the string begins with a capital letter, print capital . If not, print not capital . Use at least one method call from the Character class in your solution. You may assume that the string is non-empty (contains at least one character).
