/*
Write a method named printGPA that calculates a student's grade point average. The user will type a line of input containing the student's name, then a number of scores, followed by that many integer scores. Here are two example dialogues:

Enter a student record: Maria 5 72 91 84 89 78
Maria's grade is 82.8
Enter a student record: Jordan 4 86 71 62 90
Jordan's grade is 77.25
For example, Maria's grade is 82.8 because her average of (72 + 91 + 84 + 89 + 78) / 5 equals 82.8. Use a Scanner for user input.
